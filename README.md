# UK-Economic-Change-Analysis-Tableau-Dashboard-
# Project Overview
This project analyses percentage change across UK cities and industries using Tableau. The goal is to understand how economic performance varies geographically and sector‑by‑sector, highlighting areas of growth, decline, and strategic importance. The dashboards were created during Week 2 of my eight‑week data analysis bootcamp as part of my development in visual analytics and insight communication.

# Executive Summary
The analysis highlights notable variation in percentage change across both UK cities and major industries. Some regions show strong positive movement, while others experience stagnation or decline. At the industry level, the spread ranges from negative contraction to significant growth, underscoring the uneven nature of economic change across sectors.

These insights can support strategic planning, policy evaluation, investment decisions, and regional development initiatives.

# 🗺️ % Change by Cities
The map visualization reveals how economic change is distributed geographically:

Cities vary widely in performance, with some showing strong positive percentage change while others lag behind.

Regional clusters emerge, indicating that economic momentum is not evenly distributed across the UK.

The color‑coded markers help identify high‑growth areas versus those experiencing decline.
This geographic perspective is valuable for understanding regional disparities and identifying areas of opportunity or concern.

# 🏭 % Change by Industry
The industry bar chart highlights how different sectors are performing:

Some industries show significant positive growth, suggesting strong demand or expansion.

Others fall into negative percentage change, indicating contraction or reduced activity.

Sectors such as accommodation, administrative services, manufacturing, public administration, and transportation show clear differentiation in performance.

The range spans from approximately –1.0% to over 3.0%, illustrating the uneven impact across the economy.

This sector‑level view helps identify which industries are driving growth and which may require support or restructuring.

# 🎯 Strategic Value
This dashboard provides a foundation for:

Regional economic planning

Industry‑specific investment strategies

Workforce and skills development initiatives

Policy evaluation and forecasting

Business expansion or relocation decisions

By combining geographic and sector‑based insights, the analysis offers a comprehensive view of economic change across the UK.

# Technical Skills Demonstrated
* Tableau Dashboard Design – Built interactive dashboards using maps, bar charts, filters, and colour‑coded indicators.
* Data Cleaning & Preparation – Ensured percentage‑change fields were structured and ready for visual analysis.
* Geospatial Analysis – Used map visualisation to highlight regional economic variation across UK cities.
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Identified patterns in city‑level and industry‑level performance.
* Insight Communication – Translated economic metrics into clear, actionable insights for strategic decision‑making.

# Data Source
The dataset includes percentage‑change values for UK cities and major industries. It reflects variation in economic performance across regions and sectors, enabling both geographic and sector‑based analysis.

# How to Use the Dashboard
### Explore City‑Level Performance  
Use the map to compare percentage change across UK cities. Hover over each location to view exact values and identify high‑growth or declining regions.

### Analyse Industry Trends  
The bar chart allows you to compare percentage change across industries. This helps highlight which sectors are expanding and which are contracting.

### Interact With Filters  
If filters are available, use them to narrow down the view by region, industry, or performance range.

### Interpret Colour Scales  
Colour intensity reflects the magnitude of percentage change. Darker or brighter colours indicate stronger positive or negative movement.

### Apply Insights to Real‑World Scenarios  
The dashboard can support policy evaluation, investment decisions, workforce planning, and regional development strategies.

# Methodology
* Calculated percentage change for cities and industries based on provided metrics.
* Cleaned and structured the dataset to ensure consistency.
* Selected map and bar‑chart visualisations to highlight geographic and sector‑level differences.
* Applied colour‑coding to make growth and decline easy to interpret

# Future Improvements
* Add time‑series analysis to show how economic change evolves over multiple years.
* Include demographic or workforce indicators for deeper context.
* Add drill‑down interactions (e.g., click a city to view industry performance within that region).
* Integrate Python or SQL analysis to complement the Tableau visuals.

# Conclusion
This project provides a clear visual overview of how economic change varies across UK cities and industries. By combining geographic and sector‑based insights, the dashboard supports strategic planning, investment decisions, and policy evaluation. It demonstrates how data visualisation can make complex economic patterns easier to understand and act upon.

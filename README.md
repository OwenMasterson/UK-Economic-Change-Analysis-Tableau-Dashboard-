# UK-Economic-Change-Analysis-Tableau-Dashboard-
# Introduction
This repository contains a Tableau‑based analysis examining percentage changes across UK cities and industries. I created these dashboards during my second week of my eight week data analysis bootcamp.

# Executive Summary
The analysis highlights notable variation in percentage change across both UK cities and major industries. Some regions show strong positive movement, while others experience stagnation or decline. At the industry level, the spread ranges from negative contraction to significant growth, underscoring the uneven nature of economic change across sectors.

These insights can support strategic planning, policy evaluation, investment decisions, and regional development initiatives.

# 🗺️ % Change by Cities
The map visualization reveals how economic change is distributed geographically:

Cities vary widely in performance, with some showing strong positive percentage change while others lag behind.

Regional clusters emerge, indicating that economic momentum is not evenly distributed across the UK.

The color‑coded markers help identify high‑growth areas versus those experiencing decline.
This geographic perspective is valuable for understanding regional disparities and identifying areas of opportunity or concern.

# 🏭 % Change by Industry
The industry bar chart highlights how different sectors are performing:

Some industries show significant positive growth, suggesting strong demand or expansion.

Others fall into negative percentage change, indicating contraction or reduced activity.

Sectors such as accommodation, administrative services, manufacturing, public administration, and transportation show clear differentiation in performance.

The range spans from approximately –1.0% to over 3.0%, illustrating the uneven impact across the economy.

This sector‑level view helps identify which industries are driving growth and which may require support or restructuring.

# 🎯 Strategic Value
This dashboard provides a foundation for:

Regional economic planning

Industry‑specific investment strategies

Workforce and skills development initiatives

By combining geographic and sector‑based insights, the analysis offers a comprehensive view of economic change across the UK.
